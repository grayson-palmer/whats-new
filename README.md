# What's New?

 - This application is an exercise in creating a basic React application. This was the first project I have done utilizing `React`, `Jest`, and `Enzyme`.

### Set Up

 - Clone down this repo. Run `npm install`, then run `npm start` and go to `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Purpose

 - The purpose of this application is to present news articles based on the menu selection or a search. 

### Objectives

 - Learn and Practice creating an application using `React`
 - Create a testing suite with both snapshot and mock instance testing using `Jest` and `Enzyme`.  
 
### Challenges and Further Iterations
 Further Iterations: 
 - Pull article data using a Fetch API.
 - Accessibility and Responsive Design
 
 Challenges:
 - Search functionality was a challenge until realizing can match based the key in the articles object in state
 - Mock and Snapshot testing was a different way of testing than previously used and was an adjustment.
